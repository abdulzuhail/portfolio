# 🤖 AI-Generated Portfolio (Agentic AI Project)

This repository contains a fully auto-generated portfolio system created using **Agentic AI workflows**.  
It demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can collaboratively build a complete project — including backend logic, frontend UI, test suites, and documentation — with minimal human input.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built using an **Emergent Agent (E1)** workflow, where agents:
- Plan the application architecture  
- Generate backend, frontend, and API logic  
- Write tests and contracts  
- Produce documentation  
- Auto-commit changes as development progresses  

The result is a complete, functioning portfolio structure generated through AI-driven development.
